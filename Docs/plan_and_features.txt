Title : Curio Chrome Extension

Summary : 
The goal with this project is to create an AI based personal assistant as a browser Extension that helps increase productivity.
It should be an overlay available on each opened tab and should be ready to assist.
It should work with non-precise voice commands (like siri, alexa ...)
It should be fairly easy to use and provide all the required functionalities on the same tab the user active on.


FEATURES :

1 - available on all active chrome tabs
2 - can be invoked using a button(on the web-page), via keyboard shortcut, and voice command(like "hey siri")
3 - should be able to handle and respond precisely to non-precise commands from a user
4 - should not lead user outside of the current active tab without explicit request
